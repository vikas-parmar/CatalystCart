## What I learn from this project
- ReactJS: Gain insights into structuring components, managing state, and creating reusable UI elements.
- MUI and Styled Components: Learn how to style and theme your application using pre-designed components and custom styling techniques.
- React Router Dom: Understand how to implement navigation and dynamic routes within a React application.
- Redux Toolkit: Explore state management using Redux Toolkit for efficient application-wide state management.
- E-commerce functionality: Gain insights into implementing core e-commerce features like product listing, search, filtering, and shopping cart management.
- Best practices and project structure: Analyze the project's structure, file organization, and coding conventions for creating maintainable and scalable codebases.

## Optimizations
- I'm going to add server with strapi and implement redux toolkit with RTK query.
